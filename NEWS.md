# CUPrticles (development version)

It's new :)

PASA articles don't work yet: abstract and content end up on second page. This seems to be an issue with the CUP document class, perhaps an issue with my version of pdfTeX (version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.20, TeXLive 2019/Debian)? It looks fine on Overleaf with pdfTeX version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020)
